  Finding the cheapest ride in London isn’t as simple as picking one app. Prices fluctuate across
  Uber, Bolt, FreeNow, Smartzee—and even black cabs. Drawing from my time as a driver, I explore the
  idea of a “Ride Compass”: an app that scans all platforms, compares fares, and ensures passengers
  always get the best deal.

When I was driving for the rideshare platforms in London—Uber, Bolt, FreeNow, Smartzee—I had the privilege of hearing countless stories from the passengers in my backseat. They weren't just riders.

They were critics, economists, and navigators of London's labyrinth of transport. And almost every conversation circled back to the same theme: cost.

For years, black cabs in London carried the reputation of being prohibitively expensive. Tourists avoided them, locals dismissed them, and the ridesharing apps capitalised on this perception, presenting themselves as the "affordable alternative." Yet my time behind the wheel revealed something more complex.

Many of my passengers would tell me they juggled apps, opening Uber, then Bolt, then FreeNow—comparing fares for the same trip, hoping to save a few pounds. And every so often, the "expensive" black cab, booked through FreeNow, would undercut the sleekly marketed UberXL or Bolt ride. Traffic, demand, surge pricing, and geography all conspired to flip the narrative on its head.

That contradiction sparked a question in me: what if there was one place to see the truth?
Imagine an app—let's call it RideCompass—that connects to all the major rideshare platforms through their APIs. A customer logs in, links their existing accounts, types in their pickup and drop-off (or simply shares their GPS location), and in seconds the app scans across every platform to find the cheapest available option.

The rider wins: no more switching between apps, no more guesswork, no more myths about which platform is "always cheaper." The system would charge a nominal 1% fee once a ride is booked—a fair trade for clarity, efficiency, and real savings.

Such an app could even create strange and useful revelations: that in certain parts of the city, at certain times, a black cab might not be the luxury option, but the bargain. That a "premium" ride on one platform is outclassed by a basic ride on another. That price isn't fixed to branding—it's a moving target, and only visibility can catch it.

Londoners already compare when they buy flights, hotels, and insurance. Why not rides?

After all, when every journey begins with a choice, the real value lies not in more options—but in smarter ones.
